# FreeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine Challenge

A web app built for FreeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine challenge that DOES NOT pass the tests. 

## Project Challenges:
I built several random quote machines before I was able to pass all the FreeCodeCamp tests and beat this challenge. This version functions as intended but the code does not meet the FCC requirements. 

## Features:

- Created with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and JQuery on an HTML5 boilerplate
- Quotes are hard-coded in
- 'New Tweet' button shows a random quote and author
- 'Tweet' button creates a new Twitter message with the text "My new favourite quote:" and the curret quote and author, ready to be sent out by the user
